☕ Coffee Machine Project

📖 Overview
This project is a Python-based Coffee Machine simulation.
It allows users to order drinks, checks if the machine has enough resources, processes payments, and updates the remaining resources.
The project is designed to be extendable, meaning new drinks can be added easily in the future without changing the core logic.

🎯 Project Goals
Simulate how a real coffee machine works
Practice Python programming fundamentals
Build a project that is easy to expand with new drinks

⚙️ Features
🥤 Order drinks from the machine
🔍 Automatically check required resources
💰 Handle payment and refunds
📦 Update available resources after each order
➕ Designed to support adding new drinks in the future

🧩 Extensible Design
Drinks are defined in a structured way, making it easy to:
Add new drink names
Set custom resource requirements
Define different prices for each drink
This design allows future improvements without rewriting existing code.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3

▶️ How to Run the Project
Install Python 3 on your system.

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/coffee-machine.git
Open the project folder:
